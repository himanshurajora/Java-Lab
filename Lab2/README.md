1) Widening TypeCasting:-<br>
Converting a lower data type into a higher one is called widening type casting. It is also known as implicit conversion or casting down. It is done automatically.

byte(1) -> short(2) -> char(2) -> int(4) -> long(8) -> float(4) -> double(8) 

2) Narrowing TypeCasting:-<br>
Converting a higher data type into a lower one is called narrowing type casting. It is also known as explicit conversion or casting up. It is done manually by the programmer. If we do not perform casting then the compiler reports a compile-time error.

double(8) -> float(4) -> long(8) -> int(4) -> char(2) -> short(2) -> byte(1)
